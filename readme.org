* Getting started
  We're gonna use =Vagrant= for our dev machine (standarize our dev environment) in which we will
  + [ ] instal nginx
  + [ ] install docker
  + [ ] install git

** Creating the vagrant box
   Cause the hardest part is getting started (how do you write the =vagrantfile= ? :P) we run the following
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
   #+END_SRC
   This will create a template vagrantfile with =Ubuntu 16.04 LTS=

   By adjusting the comments etc, we ended up with
   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
  config.vm.synced_folder "./data", "/vagrant_data"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y nginx
  SHELL
end

   #+END_SRC

   Now, in our host machine we can open in browser =http://192.168.33.10/= and see the wonderful =Welcome to nginx= page :)

* Installing docker
  The goal is to put every microservice inside a docker  container.
  Our microservices will be:
  + Front: serving the webpage and managing the file upload
  + redis ? : for managing the communication of the waveforms
  + Waveform peaks generator
  + Denoisier

* Creating our waveform peaks
  BBC to the rescue! They have the wonderful [[https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform][audiowaveform]] repository and program

  
** Installation
   As they note on their github
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-needham/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install audiowaveform
   #+END_SRC
